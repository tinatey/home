		<h1 id="dailylife">Daily Life Of A Viking</h1>
		<p>Most Vikings were farmers that grew crops such as barley, oats, and rye, and 
		raised cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, chickens, and horses. Some Vikings also worked 
		as fishermen. They used circular, or Trelleborg-style, forts for defense and 
		administrative purposes, and lived in longhouses built of wood, stone, and turf. 
		Salt was vital to the Vikings, usually brought to Scandinavia by travelling 
		merchants. It was used to preserve food so it could be eaten during the long 
		winters. They wore clothing made of wool with silk decorations, or linen. Women 
		sometimes wore brooches that fastened apron straps, and belts from which they 
		hung tools like knives, needles, and shears. Vikings generally wore silver 
		jewelry, so gold pieces would have been considered very valuable. They wore 
		neck rings, dress pins, armbands, and finger rings. High status warriors or 
		Viking elites wore chain mail, and owned double-edged decorated swords that 
		could be more than three feet long. Metal helmets signified high status.</p>
		
		<h1 id="voyages">Viking Voyages</h1>
		<p>Most ships sailed at approximately 3 to 6 knots. One knot is about one nautical 
		mile, which is equal to approx. 1.8 kilometers. If the wind was blowing in the 
		same direction as they were traveling in, the voyage would take less time. If 
		the winds caused waves that were way too big, the Vikings would have to slow 
		down. Waves could destroy ships or throw people overboard, and bad weather 
		could lead them in the wrong direction causing the voyage to become longer 
		than planned. There were many cases in which Vikings stumbled upon land that 
		they never intended to find, so if they hit land they would follow the coastline 
		all the way to their destination. Their ships ranged anywhere from 45.9ft (14m) 
		to 122.4ft (37.3m) long.</p>
	
		<h1 id="settlements">Viking Settlements</h1>
		<p>The Vikings were the only European seafarers at that time to travel so far 
		from their homeland. The first big Viking raid took place around A.D. 793 on 
		the island of Lindisfarne. The Vikings also conquered three Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. 
		In later Viking raids, they could have attacked in fleets of 250 ships or more. 
		The word Viking literally means raider, although raiding was not the only thing 
		they did. The Vikings explored what are now 37 countries. They colonized parts 
		of the Scottish Isles, France, Iceland, and Arctic Scandinavia and traveled 
		through the North Atlantic and Russian waterways. They had a colony in Greenland 
		that lasted 500 years, and got all the way to the edge of North America. In fact, 
		the first European person to discover North America may have been a Viking. The 
		first to stumble upon the shores of North America may have been Leif Eriksson, 
		or Leif the Lucky, not Columbus. The only site in the New World that archeologists 
		are certain is a Viking settlement is called L’Anse aux Meadows, a site discovered 
		in the 1960s in northern Newfoundland. In 2015, archeologists found another 
		potential Viking settlement on a peninsula in the south of Newfoundland 
		that stretches out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is called Point Rosee.</p>
		
		<h1 id="womenleaders">Women As Leaders</h1>
		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, you wouldn’t think of Vikings as the kind of people who would 
		let a woman fight alongside the men. One early tenth-century Irish text tells 
		of a woman called Inghen Ruaidh, or Red Girl, named after the colour of her 
		hair. She was a female warrior who led a Viking fleet to Ireland in the 10th 
		century. In the Viking trading center of Birka, Sweden, archeologists examined 
		the remains of a Viking warrior that had buried with a multitude of weapons. 
		They expected to find that the warrior was male, but the grave belonged to a 
		woman. Numerous Viking sagas tell of shield-maidens fighting the same battles 
		as male warriors, and hint that warriors were not all men.</p>
		
		<h1 id="celebrate">Some Viking celebrations included:</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Walpurgis Night, also called Valborg Night (celebrated April 30)</li>
			<li>Midsummer, or Midsommardagen (celebrated June 24)</li>
			<li>Yule, also called J&oacute;l, a celebration that evolved into what is now Christmas</li>
